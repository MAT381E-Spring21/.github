# MAT381E: Introduction to Data Science

This is the `GitHub` organization of **MAT381E: Introduction to Data Science** at Department of Mathematics, Istanbul Technical University. 
Throughout the semester, we will cover `R` data science packages and focus on data importing, cleaning, reshaping, manipulating, and visualizing. 
The main topics which we cover are:

 * Tools for data importing, manipulating, and tidying.
 * Basic principles of data visualization and data visualization tools.
 * Handling with strings and dates in data. 
 * Scraping data from web.
 * Data extraction from social networking sites such as Twitter. 
 * Basic principles of text mining. 
 * Network analysis and visualization. 
 * Basic principles of geographic information system.  
 * Visualization of spatial and urban data.
 * Web-based applications.
 * Relational databases. 
 * Reproducible research.
 
In this course, students are expected to develop an introductory data science project motivated by data for "Social Good".
For final projects, please visit [here](https://github.com/MAT381E/Final-Projects).

*ps. Over the years, I am planning to extend the scope of the projects, while sticking around "Data for Social Good".
